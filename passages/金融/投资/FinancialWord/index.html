<h4 id="A-M-T"><a href="#A-M-T" class="headerlink" title="A.M.T."></a>A.M.T.</h4><pre><code>Alternative Minimum Tax is a calculation designed to ensure that individuals and corporations pay their &apos;fair share&apos; of federal income taxes. Interest on private activity municipal securities is subject to A.M.T.
</code></pre><h4 id="Accrued-Interest"><a href="#Accrued-Interest" class="headerlink" title="Accrued Interest"></a>Accrued Interest</h4><pre><code>Based on the amount of interest earned, but not paid, as of the pricing date. Amount of interest accumulated, but not yet paid, between semiannual payment dates.

Ask your Financial Advisor for current rates.
</code></pre><h4 id="Adjustable-rate-preferreds"><a href="#Adjustable-rate-preferreds" class="headerlink" title="Adjustable rate preferreds"></a>Adjustable rate preferreds</h4><p>Perpetual securities with a variable, rather than fixed,<br>quarterly dividend that floats between an upper and lower range, or collar.</p>
<h4 id="Adjusted-Cost-Basis"><a href="#Adjusted-Cost-Basis" class="headerlink" title="Adjusted Cost Basis"></a>Adjusted Cost Basis</h4><pre><code>The original cost of securities less the amortized premium (or plus the accretion on an original issue discount bond). Mortgage-Backed Securities or Market Discount Bonds are not adjusted.
</code></pre><h4 id="Average-Effective-Maturity"><a href="#Average-Effective-Maturity" class="headerlink" title="Average Effective Maturity"></a>Average Effective Maturity</h4><pre><code>For a single bond, it is a measure of maturity that takes into account the possibility that a bond might be called back to the issuer. For a portfolio of bonds, average effective maturity is the weighted average of the maturities of the underlying bonds. The measure is computed by weighing each bond&apos;s maturity by its market value with respect to the portfolio and the likelihood of any of the bonds being called.
</code></pre><h4 id="Average-After-State-Tax-Yield-ATY"><a href="#Average-After-State-Tax-Yield-ATY" class="headerlink" title="Average After State Tax Yield (ATY)"></a>Average After State Tax Yield (ATY)</h4><pre><code>The weighted average yield after state income taxes are paid on out of state bonds. It reflects both the tax free yield of an in state bond and the after tax yield of an out of state bond.
</code></pre><h4 id="Average-Coupon"><a href="#Average-Coupon" class="headerlink" title="Average Coupon"></a>Average Coupon</h4><pre><code>The weighted average of all the coupons in the portfolio. Zero-Coupon Bonds are included in this calculation.
</code></pre><h4 id="Average-Yield-to-Maturity"><a href="#Average-Yield-to-Maturity" class="headerlink" title="Average Yield to Maturity"></a>Average Yield to Maturity</h4><pre><code>Weighted average yield that assumes all bonds will go to maturity. It also assumes that all callable bonds will not be called.
</code></pre><h4 id="Average-Yield-To-Worst-Purchase-Yield"><a href="#Average-Yield-To-Worst-Purchase-Yield" class="headerlink" title="Average Yield-To-Worst (Purchase Yield)"></a>Average Yield-To-Worst (Purchase Yield)</h4><pre><code>The weighted average yield based on the purchase price of the bond. It assumes the bonds are purchased at the lower of either the yield to call or the yield to maturity.
</code></pre><h4 id="Average-Yield-To-Worst-in-Years"><a href="#Average-Yield-To-Worst-in-Years" class="headerlink" title="Average Yield-To-Worst in Years"></a>Average Yield-To-Worst in Years</h4><pre><code>The weighted average of years based on the purchase price of the bonds. It assumes the bonds are purchased at the lower of either the yield to the call or the yield to maturity.
</code></pre><h4 id="Bonds"><a href="#Bonds" class="headerlink" title="Bonds"></a>Bonds</h4><pre><code>Bonds are affected by a number of risks, including fluctuations in interest rates, credit risk and prepayment risk. In general, interest rate risk occurs when prevailing interest rates rise, causing bond prices to fall. Credit risk, which is the possibility that the issuer of a security will be unable to make interest payments and repay the principal on its debt. Similarly, a decline in an issuer&apos;s credit rating, or credit worthiness, can cause a bond&apos;s price to decline. High yield bonds are subject to additional risks such as increased risk of default and greater volatility because of the lower credit quality of the issues. Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.
</code></pre><h4 id="Bond-Equivalent-Yield-BEY"><a href="#Bond-Equivalent-Yield-BEY" class="headerlink" title="Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)"></a>Bond Equivalent Yield (BEY)</h4><pre><code>Also referred to as a Corporate Bond Equivalent Yield (CBE), BEY is an adjustment to the mortgage yield to reflect assumed semi-annual payment of cash flows (rather than monthly). Converting monthly Mortgage-Backed Securities (MBS) cash flows to a semi-annual equivalent allows a more meaningful comparison of MBS values to corporate and government bonds. The conversion primarily reflects the benefit to the MBS holder of reinvesting MBS cash flows monthly rather than semi-annually, as is the case with other fixed-income securities. Bond equivalent yield calculations are currently not provided in the FIHNW report.
</code></pre><h4 id="Cost-Basis"><a href="#Cost-Basis" class="headerlink" title="Cost Basis"></a>Cost Basis</h4><pre><code>The price originally paid for the bonds.
</code></pre><h4 id="Convertible-Bond"><a href="#Convertible-Bond" class="headerlink" title="Convertible Bond"></a>Convertible Bond</h4><pre><code>A corporate bond that can be exchanged, at the option of the holder, for a specific number of shares of the company&apos;s stock. Because a convertible bond is a bond with a stock option built into it, it will usually offer a lower than prevailing rate of return. It is subject to market risk, interest rate risk and default risk.
</code></pre><h4 id="Convexity"><a href="#Convexity" class="headerlink" title="Convexity"></a>Convexity</h4><pre><code>A measure of the curvature in the relationship between bond prices and bond yields that demonstrates how the duration of a bond changes as the interest rate changes. Convexity is used as a risk-management tool, and helps to measure and manage the amount of market risk to which a portfolio of bonds is exposed.
</code></pre><h4 id="Corp-Muni-Bonds"><a href="#Corp-Muni-Bonds" class="headerlink" title="Corp/Muni Bonds"></a>Corp/Muni Bonds</h4><pre><code>Bonds can be called prior to maturity which may reduce yield. Ordinary call information is above. Other call features may exist. Bond prices may fluctuate reflecting market interest rates and the issuer&apos;s credit status.
</code></pre><h4 id="Current-Yield"><a href="#Current-Yield" class="headerlink" title="Current Yield"></a>Current Yield</h4><pre><code>Coupon divided by the price. As an example a bond with a 5.00% coupon offered at $105 would have a current yield of 4.76%; 5.00/105=4.76%.
</code></pre><h4 id="Double-Barrelled-Bond"><a href="#Double-Barrelled-Bond" class="headerlink" title="Double-Barrelled Bond"></a>Double-Barrelled Bond</h4><pre><code>A municipal bond secured by a defined revenue source as well as the full faith and credit of an issuer that has taxing power. It has both general obligation and revenue pledges.
</code></pre><h4 id="Default-Risk"><a href="#Default-Risk" class="headerlink" title="Default Risk"></a>Default Risk</h4><pre><code>Possibility that a bond issuer will fail to pay principal or interest when due. Defaults can also occur for failure to meet nonpayment obligations, such as reporting requirements, or when a material problem occurs for the issuer, such as a bankruptcy.
</code></pre><h4 id="Effective-Duration"><a href="#Effective-Duration" class="headerlink" title="Effective Duration"></a>Effective Duration</h4><pre><code>Effective Duration measures the approximate percentage volatility of a bond&apos;s value for a 1% (100 bp) change in interest rates.
</code></pre><h4 id="Estimated-Accrued-Interest"><a href="#Estimated-Accrued-Interest" class="headerlink" title="Estimated Accrued Interest"></a>Estimated Accrued Interest</h4><pre><code>Based on the amount of interest earned, but not paid, as of the date the report was priced.
</code></pre><h4 id="Estimated-Principal-Cost"><a href="#Estimated-Principal-Cost" class="headerlink" title="Estimated Principal Cost"></a>Estimated Principal Cost</h4><pre><code>Dollar value of proposed bonds excluding accrued interest.
</code></pre><h4 id="Escrow-to-Maturity-ETM"><a href="#Escrow-to-Maturity-ETM" class="headerlink" title="Escrow-to-Maturity (ETM)"></a>Escrow-to-Maturity (ETM)</h4><pre><code>Municipal securities for which proceeds have been deposited into an escrow account to pay principal and interest on the securities.
</code></pre><h4 id="Face-Amount"><a href="#Face-Amount" class="headerlink" title="Face Amount"></a>Face Amount</h4><pre><code>The nominal value or dollar value of a bond stated by the issuer. It is the amount paid to the holder at maturity (generally $1,000). Also known as &apos;par value&apos; or simply &apos;par&apos;.
</code></pre><h4 id="Factor"><a href="#Factor" class="headerlink" title="Factor"></a>Factor</h4><pre><code>A decimal value that reflects the proportion of outstanding principal balance of a Mortgage-Backed Security. The factor may change each month in relation to its original principal value.
</code></pre><h4 id="Floating-Rate-Bond"><a href="#Floating-Rate-Bond" class="headerlink" title="Floating-Rate Bond"></a>Floating-Rate Bond</h4><pre><code>Securities with a coupon interest rate that is adjusted periodically based upon market conditions.
</code></pre><h4 id="General-Obligation-Bond"><a href="#General-Obligation-Bond" class="headerlink" title="General Obligation Bond"></a>General Obligation Bond</h4><pre><code>A municipal bond backed by the credit and &quot;taxing power&quot; of the issuing jurisdiction rather than the revenue from a given project.
</code></pre><h4 id="Investment-Grade"><a href="#Investment-Grade" class="headerlink" title="Investment Grade"></a>Investment Grade</h4><pre><code>Bonds considered suitable for preservation of invested capital; ordinarily, those rated Baa3 or better by Moody&apos;s Investors Service, or BBB- or better by Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s Corporation
</code></pre><h4 id="High-Yield-Bond"><a href="#High-Yield-Bond" class="headerlink" title="High-Yield Bond"></a>High-Yield Bond</h4><pre><code>A bond with unfavorable credit characteristics that is typically non-rated or rated below investment grade. A high-yield bond trades at yields substantially higher than bonds with more favorable credit characteristics and often suffers from lack of liquidity and marketability and carries more risk in exchange for the higher yield.
</code></pre><h4 id="International-Global-Investing"><a href="#International-Global-Investing" class="headerlink" title="International/Global Investing"></a>International/Global Investing</h4><pre><code>International investing may not be for everyone. There may be additional risk associated with international investing, including foreign, economic, political, monetary and/or legal factors, changing currency exchange rates, foreign taxes, and differences in financial and accounting standards. The possibility that adverse political events, financial problems, or natural disasters in a country or region will cause investments in that country or region to lose value. The risks of investing in emerging or developing markets can be substantially greater than the risks of investing in developed markets.
</code></pre><h4 id="Mortgage-Backed-Securities"><a href="#Mortgage-Backed-Securities" class="headerlink" title="Mortgage-Backed Securities"></a>Mortgage-Backed Securities</h4><pre><code>Mortgage-backed securities (&quot;MBS&quot;), which include collateralized mortgage obligations (&quot;CMOs&quot;), also referred to as real estate mortgage investment conduits (&quot;REMICs&quot;), may not be suitable for all investors. There is the possibility of early return of principal due to mortgage prepayments, which can reduce expected yield and result in reinvestment risk. Conversely, return of principal may be slower than initial prepayment speed assumptions, extending the average life of the security up to its listed maturity date (also referred to as extension risk).
Additionally, the underlying collateral supporting non-Agency MBS may default on principal and interest payments. In certain cases, this could cause the income stream of the security to decline and result in loss of principal. Further, an insufficient level of credit support may result in a downgrade of a mortgage bond&apos;s credit rating and lead to a higher probability of principal loss and increased price volatility. Investments in subordinated MBS involve greater credit risk of default than the senior classes of the same issue. Default risk may be pronounced in cases where the MBS security is secured by, or evidencing an interest in, a relatively small or less diverse pool of underlying mortgage loans.
MBS are also sensitive to interest rate changes which can negatively impact the market value of the security. During times of heightened volatility, MBS can experience greater levels of illiquidity and larger price movements. Price volatility may also occur from other factors including, but not limited to, prepayments, future prepayment expectations, credit concerns, underlying collateral performance and technical changes in the market.
Please read offering documents and/or prospectus information carefully for the risks associated with the particular MBS security you are purchasing.
</code></pre><h4 id="Municipal-Equivalent-Yield-MEY"><a href="#Municipal-Equivalent-Yield-MEY" class="headerlink" title="Municipal Equivalent Yield (MEY)"></a>Municipal Equivalent Yield (MEY)</h4><pre><code>The MEY factor will help you determine whether out-of-state municipals are advantageous on a yield basis. In other words, the MEY factors will show how much you need to earn on an out-of-state municipal bond in order to account for the income taxes paid at the state level.
</code></pre><h4 id="Market-Value"><a href="#Market-Value" class="headerlink" title="Market Value"></a>Market Value</h4><pre><code>The value of the portfolio, excluding accrued interest, at the pricing date.
</code></pre><h4 id="Missing-Data"><a href="#Missing-Data" class="headerlink" title="Missing Data"></a>Missing Data</h4><pre><code>If purchase price is unknown, the High Net Worth Report will show the issue price (often $100.00). If settlement date is unknown, High Net Worth will use the dated date as a settlement date. In addition, when a bond has 0.001 in the coupon field it indicates that the security has a coupon greater the 0% but less than 1% and may not reflect the actual coupon. Please contact your Financial Advisor if you have any questions about the actual coupon or to provide your Financial Advisor with accurate purchase dates and prices.

</code></pre><h4 id="Par-Amount"><a href="#Par-Amount" class="headerlink" title="Par Amount"></a>Par Amount</h4><pre><code>The face amount of a security, payable to the holder at maturity.
</code></pre><h4 id="PSA"><a href="#PSA" class="headerlink" title="PSA"></a>PSA</h4><pre><code>&apos;Prepayment speed assumption&apos; measures the rate of principal prepayments, which in effect influences the average life of a bond, pre-payment window, and bond equivalent yield.
</code></pre><h4 id="Par-Amount-1"><a href="#Par-Amount-1" class="headerlink" title="Par Amount"></a>Par Amount</h4><pre><code>The face amount of a security, payable to the holder at maturity.
</code></pre><h4 id="Preferred-securities"><a href="#Preferred-securities" class="headerlink" title="Preferred securities"></a>Preferred securities</h4><pre><code>can be called prior to maturity, which may reduce yield if purchased at a premium. Preferred securities may be subject to other call features or corporate restrictions that may have an effect similar to a call. Prices may fluctuate reflecting market interest rates and the issuer&apos;s credit status.
Finally, bonds can be subject to prepayment risk. When interest rates fall, an issuer may choose to borrow money at a lower interest rate, while paying off its previously issued bonds. As a consequence, underlying bonds will lose the interest payments from the investment and will be forced to reinvest in a market where prevailing interest rates are lower than when the initial investment was made.

</code></pre><h4 id="Scheduled-After-Tax-Annual-Income"><a href="#Scheduled-After-Tax-Annual-Income" class="headerlink" title="Scheduled After-Tax Annual Income"></a>Scheduled After-Tax Annual Income</h4><pre><code>Net income after federal and state taxes are applied. This calculation assumes that the investor itemizes deductions on his federal tax return. Currently, the report does not calculate the after-tax yield on various agency securities.
</code></pre><h4 id="Scheduled-Annual-Income"><a href="#Scheduled-Annual-Income" class="headerlink" title="Scheduled Annual Income"></a>Scheduled Annual Income</h4><pre><code>The total annual income that will be generated by the portfolio.

The TEY can be used to illustrate to investors the impact of both Federal and State income taxes on their taxable investments. If the municipal bond is out of the clients home state then we use the after state tax yield to calculate TEY.
